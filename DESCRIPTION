Description: Training datasets for iC10; which implements the classifier described in the paper 'Genome-driven integrated classification of breast cancer validated in over 7,500 samples' (Ali HR et al., Genome Biology 2014). It uses copy number and/or expression form breast cancer data, trains a pamr classifier (Tibshirani et al.) with the features available and predicts the iC10 group. Genomic annotation for the training dataset has been obtained from Mark Dunning's lluminaHumanv3.db package.
