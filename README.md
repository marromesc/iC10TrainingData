# iC10TrainingData R package with support for extra assembly

This package is a fork of CRAN R package ‘iC10TrainingData’ with minor modification for supporting extra genome assembly (e.g. hg38). 

Hope someday the official package will adopt all necessary genome assemblies.

Install this hg38-supported package from GitHub:

remotes::install_github("marromesc/iC10TrainingData")
